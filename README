Introduction:

seatris is a tetris clone. Simple as that. Written as it's one of my
favourite games and I've been meaning to write it for ten years now.
Slightly helped by the fact that the previous Linux Tetris game I'd been
playing (tt) didn't compile under glibc.


Playing:

Keys are:
j,l     : left, right
k       : rotate
<space> : drop
m	: drop by one line
+	: increase level
p       : pause
q	: quit
Ctrl-L	: refresh screen


Running:

seatris can be given several command line options:

-s            : Print out the high score table.
-l x          : Start at level x. (max 20)
-k "abcdefgh" : Use key a as left
                        b as right
                        c as rotate
                        d as drop
                        e as drop by one line
                        f as increase level
                        g as pause
                        h as quit.
                Default is "jlk m+pq"
-f <filename> : Use <filename> as an alternative high score file. Does
                not work if seatris is SUID or SGID.
-b            : Force seatris not to use colour, even if ncurses reports
                that the display is capable of it.
-c            : Force seatris to use colour, even if ncurses reports that
                the display isn't capable of it. May not work.


Config file:

Several options can also be set via either a global config file
(/etc/seatrisrc by default) or a per user config file (~/.seatrisrc).
They are all overridden by the command line options. The options are:

KEYS abcdefgh
	The same as the -k command line option.

LEVEL <level>
	The default start level.

MONO <true|false>
	Force the use of no colour, as with the -b command line switch.

SCOREFILE <filename>
	The full pathname to the desired highscore file to be used. Note
	this cannot be used from the per user config file if seatris is
	SUID or SGID.

DOTS <true|false>
	Enable the use of dots to help guide the position of pieces in
	the playing grid.

SQUIGGLES <true|false>
	Enable the '$' characters at the bottom of the playing field to
	help guide pieces.

BOLD <true|false>
	Enable the use of bold colours instead of darker ones.


Platforms:

seatris should be fairly portable - certainly the aim is to make it so.
Unfortunately I only have a limited range of systems to try it on and
so I can only say that I've tried it successfully on Linux, FreeBSD and
HP/UX.


Name:

Why is it called seatris? Well, you see, I went to a careers fairs and
Seagate were there. And they gave me a funny executive toy sort of
thing, that just happens to only fit together with both sides covered
when it's the in the shape of a tetris block. So it's the tetris shape
maker and I renamed tetris to seatris as it's as good (or bad) a name as
any. Note this does not imply any affiliation or support of Seagate,
other than the fact they give away cool tetris shape makers if you ask
nicely.


Notes:
Ideally seatris should be installed SGID games so that the high score
file can be accessed for all users. Please note that this is a slight
security risk.
