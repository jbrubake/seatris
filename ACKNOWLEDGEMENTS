David Ball		Helped work out the pre coding details. Probably
<db@earth.li>		responsible for me bothering to write tetris at all,
			even if he tries to claim otherwise. Also submitted
			several patches for options I would never have thought
			of.

Simon Huggins		Tested stuff, complained and provided some features
<huggie@earth.li>	and bug fixes.

Toby Jaffey		Tested stuff and fed me tequila.
<toby@earth.li>

Tim Bagot		Managed to make it crash more times than anyone else.
<tsb@earth.li>		Forced the ability to change the keys easily due to an
			extremely odd keyboard layout.

Lynx			The autoconf from Lynx provided much help in trying
			to sort out ncurses etc issues.

Eric Nadeau		Provided UI changes and vi style keys.
